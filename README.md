### Big Thanks to the tutorial here: https://medium.com/@jaredloson/a-replacement-for-window-confirm-using-promises-and-react-hooks-cfc011e76a7a

I have added some more feature to it, and it's a complete example with list item deletion confirmation.

You are free to use it in your project. I hope it will help you !!
